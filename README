   Consists of two folders:

   KiTrack: most of the package is in here: a Cellular Automaton, a Hopfield Neural Network, the hit
   and track classes (abstract base classes)

   Criteria: in here are all the criteria classes are stored.





Version History
=============================================================================================================
 

  -----------------------------
 | changes since last version  |
  -----------------------------
 
      - Added new classes for SubsetFinding: 
         Subset, SubsetSimple, SubsetHopfieldNN
         They are based on the classes: ITrackSubset, TrackSubsetSimple and TrackSubsetHopfieldNN
         The difference is they are templated, thus the basic algorithms can be used with any class.
         So if one wants for example to use the Hopfield Network Subset with an own track class or with
         something that is not even a track, this can now be done.
 

  ---------
 | v01-00  |
  ---------

      - first version: splitted the software from the ForwardTracking package at version v01-02
      - Moved SimpleCircle from KiTrack to Criteria (as it is used by them)
      - Commented out drawSegments() in Automaton, because it is dependent on the framework. 
         (functionality should be restored in a different way)
