   /** A segment is a part of a track. This track can be real or not (for example ghosttracks). 
    * It may consist of only one hit or of 2000 hits or whatever number is useful.
    * 
    * What makes it different from a Track, is that it is connected. It has: children and parents.
    * Children are segments connected to this one on lower layers and parents are segments connected
    * on higher layers.
    * 
    * This is a very useful concept, as it allows to combine them to a track or to compare different possibilities
    * a track can be formed.
    * 
    * Segments are especially used in the Automaton.
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * I will throughout all documentation use words like 1-segment and 2-segment.
    * This simply refers to the number of hits stored in it.
    * 
    * So a 1-segment simply is a hit ( an AutHit to be more specific ), but with the possibility
    * to be connected to others.
    * 
    * 
    *   
    * An important property of the segment is its state.
    * The state is a concept used in the cellular automaton and is merely an integer. At the beginning this
    * is 0. When the automaton performs its work it will rate the segments it contains and raise their states
    * if they a good. So the state is a kind of quality indicator telling how good a segment is.
    * 
    * TODO: why are there inner and outer states?
    * 
    * TODO: what is the order of the autHits? (from outside to inside -> but should this be always that way or flexible?)
