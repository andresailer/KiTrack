   /** The class for the cellular automaton.
    * 
    * It stores segments ( a number of hits, see the segment header file ) on layers
    * 
    * Via the method doAutomaton() it raises the states of the segments, if they have are connected to an inner
    * segment with the same state which satisfies all criteria. <br>
    * Criteria are passed to this class via the addCriterion() method. A criterion is an object that takes
    * two segments and tells, if they are compatible.
    * For more detailed information see the interface: ICriterion and the different classes derived from it
    * (they all start with Crit )
    * 
    * The raising of the states will be repeated until no more changes happen. 
    * 
    * After this the cleanBadStates method can be used to erase all segments, that have a state lower than their layer,
    * which essentially means, that they are not connected all the way through to layer 0.
    * 
    * After this the method cleanBadConnections() can be used, to get rid of all connections of segments, that don't fulfill
    * the currently loaded criteria.
    * 
    * 
    * If another round of doAutomaton() wants to be used, you should first call the method resetStates, to set all states of
    * the segments back to 0.
    * 
    * 
    * The method lengthenSegments is used to make the segments 1 hit longer. So if you have 2-segments 
    * (segments consisting of 2 hits) and performed the automaton on it and now want to proceed with longer 3-segments
    * (segments consiting of 3 hits) you would call the lengthenSegments() method.
    * 
    * After this don't forget, that the criteria you loaded before were for 2-segments, so you should erase them with
    * clearCriteria() and then add criteria for 3-segments.
    * 
    * 
    * Once you are done with all this, you might want to get back all the possible tracks stored in the automaton.
    * For this use the getTracks() method. It will return all tracks that are possible given the current stored
    * segments and their connections.
    * But be warned: when there are still a lot of hits and connections, there will be a high number of possible tracks,
    * therefore taking some time.
